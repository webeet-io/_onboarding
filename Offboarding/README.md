# 📘 Offboarding Guide

## 🎯 Goal: Turn Your Internship Into a Launchpad

In your final week, take time to reflect on everything you’ve done, and use it to polish your resume, update your LinkedIn, and set yourself up for your next opportunity.

**🔰 Why This Matters** - Being able to explain your experience is almost as important as the experience itself.

Whether you're applying for a job, joining a new project, or introducing yourself in an interview — you’ll need to clearly communicate what you worked on, what tools you used, and how you grew.

This offboarding process will help you organize your thoughts, highlight your achievements, and turn your internship into a strong story you can confidently share.

## 🔎 Step 1: Retro

### 🔹 1.1 Review What You’ve Done

1. Ask the AI you’ve worked with:
   - “Can you summarize what I did during this internship?”
   - “What were my key tasks or contributions?”
2. Skim past standups, messages, commits, or notes — what stands out?

### 🔹 1.2 Write Your Resume Entry

1. Pick 2–3 key achievements to highlight.

2. Draft 3–5 bullet points using this formula: What did I build / improve / contribute → Using what tools / skills → With what result.

3. You can use AI to refine your wording but avoid `--` (long dash) and too much fluff

   > **Software Engineering Example**
   >
   > - Built a microservice using Fastify and TypeScript, deployed on AWS Lambda, as part of a larger event-driven system.
   > - Integrated the service into a Remix-based React frontend to improve data delivery speed across the app.
   > - Worked with team to design API contracts and ensure compatibility across services in a microservice architecture.

   > **Data Analytics Example**
   >
   > - Explored and integrated multiple third-party APIs to collect real-time data for AI training workflows.
   > - Cleaned and transformed incoming data to fit internal schema using Python and Pandas.
   > - Collaborated with engineering to test API performance and ensure smooth data ingestion across pipelines.

   > **Cybersecurity Example**
   >
   > - Configured AWS GuardDuty, Security Hub, and CloudTrail to monitor for threats and unusual activity in a cloud environment.
   > - Analyzed security alerts and improved IAM policies based on findings.
   > - Documented setup procedures and shared recommendations with the team to enhance overall security posture.

### 🔹 1.3 Ask For Feedback

Once you’ve drafted your resume bullet points, it's time to get a second opinion.

- [ ] Ask your peers for feedback on your bullet points. What’s clear? What could be stronger?
- [ ] When you feel your resume and LinkedIn drafts are ready, **ask your lead for feedback** on how accurately they reflect your work.

You can also offer to give feedback in return — it helps everyone improve.

## 💅 Step 2: Polish

After receiving feedback (and making improvements where needed), it’s time to wrap things up with clarity and confidence.

### 🔹 2.1 LinkedIn Profile

- Add the internship under your **Experience** section.
- Reuse your strongest resume bullet points.
- Adjust your **title** to reflect the kind of position you're aiming for.  
  _(Avoid “Intern,” “Junior,” “In process,” or “Student.” Think: Software Engineer, Data Analyst, etc.)_

**Bonus: Recommendations**

- Ask your **peers and lead** for a recommendation on LinkedIn.
- Keep it simple — a few sentences can go a long way.

### 🔹 2.2 Share a LinkedIn Post

This stage is optional, but completing it can significantly increase your profile's visibility. 

- Write a short post reflecting on your experience.
- Mention what you learned, built, or are proud of.
- Tag your lead, teammates, and **@webeet.io** if it feels right.

## 🧠 Step 3: Practice

**Narrative Mastery** is the skill of crafting and delivering a clear, structured, and compelling story that communicates who you are, what you’ve done, and where you’re headed — all in a way that resonates with interviewers.

Writing about your experience is one thing — _talking_ about it in an interview is where it really counts. Use AI to simulate interviews and help you practice speaking about your Weebeet internship with clarity and confidence.

By the end of this practice session, you should be able to:

- Introduce your Weebeet internship in 1–2 minutes
- Share your main contributions using STAR(R)
- Reflect on challenges and learning moments
- Sound confident, clear, and well-prepared for interviews

Just a couple of hours of practice can make a big difference in how you present yourself.

### 🔹 3.1 AI Interviewer

Go to the AI tool you've been working with during your internship. If you have an AI tools that enable live conversation (like ChatGPT 4), it will be advisable to use over chat so you can practice your speach.

> "Can you act as a hiring manager and interview me about my internship experience at Weebeet?"

Let the AI ask you questions — answer them out loud or type your answers and ask the AI for feedback.

### 🔹 3.2 The STAR(R) Method

The **STAR(R)** method helps you tell your story with structure and impact:

- **S** – Situation → What was the context?
- **T** – Task → What were you trying to do?
- **A** – Action → What steps did _you_ take?
- **R** – Result → What happened in the end?
- **(R)** – Reflection → What did you learn or what would you do differently?

**You can also ask the AI:**

- “Can you ask me behavioral questions about teamwork, problem-solving, or learning?”
- “Can you review my answer using the STAR(R) method and suggest improvements?”

> 📝 _Tip:_ Ask the AI to help you rewrite your answer in STAR(R) format if you're unsure.
