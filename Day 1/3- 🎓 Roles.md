    Anastasia is in charge of the entire Data track. She ensures that interns and leads in this domain are solving real-world data problems while learning best practices. From analytics to dashboards, she guides both the quality of the work and the development of the team.

### 🧪 **Interns – You!**

Whether you're in **Data**, **Engineering**, or **Security**, you are a **Junior Professional in training**. Your job is to learn by doing—working on real client projects under the mentorship of your domain lead. 

You’ll be expected to communicate clearly, ask questions, take ownership, and grow through feedback. This structure is designed to give you both **support and responsibility**. Every leader above you is here to help you succeed.
