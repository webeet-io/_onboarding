# 👾 Communication

Discord is our main tool for internal communication at Webeet — not email. It’s where we work, coordinate, and stay connected across teams and time zones.

If you’re new to Discord, take a few minutes to get familiar with the basics. It’s fast, flexible, and fun — as long as we all use it the right way.

### **⚒️ How we use Discord at Webeet**

Discord is powerful, but only works if we keep things organized. That means: 

1. Clear messages
2. The right channels
3. And always use **threads, always.**

---

### **🧵 Use Threads — Always**

Threads are how we keep conversations readable. Every new topic in a channel should be started as a thread, not as a freeform message in the main chat.

Before posting, **scan the channel** to see if someone already brought up the topic. If not:

1. Post a **clear title** in the channel
2. Immediately continue the conversation **inside the thread**

Avoid posting a title and then writing the rest as separate messages—people might miss your update.

  <summary>Thread in a channel</summary>

  You can see that Mayer created a thread, and then all message (all related communication) is contained within the thread, making it easier to track updates.

  When Pressing on a thread, you can see all the relevant communication (the example below).

  You can see the title of the thread ("Populating the backlog"), and inside all the relevant communication (below the title).

### **🧹 Keep Messages Clean and Thoughtful**

- **Write the full message** before hitting send (don’t send it in parts).
- **Structure with bullet points or numbers** to make it easier to read.
- **Tag only** the people who need to see it
- If you're unsure — write it first in your notes

---

### **🧘‍♂️ Be Clear in Your Messages**

Respect your teammates' time and mental load by being direct and specific in your messages. Avoid vague messages like “Can we talk?” or “I need something.” Instead, share:

- **What you need** – Be clear about the topic or request.
- **How urgent it is** – Does it need to happen today? This week?
- **How long it will take** – Is it a quick 5-minute sync, or a deeper 30-minute discussion?

This helps others prioritize and respond effectively without back-and-forth. Example:

> “Hey, I’d like to get your feedback on my latest PR. It’s not urgent, but ideally this week. Shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes—can I grab a slot tomorrow?”
>

### **📺 Use the Right Channels**

We have dedicated channels for different topics. Keeping conversations in the right place helps everyone stay organized and find information faster. Here’s how we use them:

- **#announcement** – Team-wide updates and important news.
    - 🔒 *Only admins should post here.*
- **#general** – For useful resources, opportunities, meetups and anything else the team can benefit from.
- **#random** – Memes, fun stuff, and off-topic chat. Keep it light.
- **#gratitude** – Shout out a teammate, celebrate a win, or spread some positive vibes 💜
- **#team-engineering / #team-data / #team-security** – Your domain-specific space. Day-to-day updates, support requests, and technical threads.
- **#project-[name]** – Project-specific cross-domain collaboration. Use threads for each major topic or task.

### **❞ Quote & Reply Clearly**

If you’re replying to a specific part of a message, **quote it using code format or blockquote (`>` or ```)**. 

It helps keep context clear and makes threads easier to follow.

This is a `code format` (made by using ` twice, at the beginning and end)

```

This is a code block, create by using ` 3 times at the beginning and 3 times at the end

```

### **💻 Sharing Code**

When sharing code on Discord, make it easy for others to read and respond:

- **Use code blocks**
    
    For small snippets or single lines, use inline backticks like this ` … ` (`…`)
    
    For multiple lines, use triple backticks:
    
    ```
    
    your code here
    
    ```
    
    ```
    This is a result of ```
    ```
    
- **Don’t paste long code into Discord**
    
    If the code lives in a repo, **link directly to the relevant lines on GitHub** instead of pasting the entire block. It keeps the channel clean and lets others see the code in context.
    

(More on how we use GitHub later.)

### **📚 Prefer Text Over Recordings**

Stick to writing. It’s **searchable, accessible, and respectful** of everyone’s time and noise level. Use voice/video only when it’s clearly better for the topic.
