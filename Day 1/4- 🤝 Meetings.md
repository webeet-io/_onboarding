# 🤝 Meetings

At Webeet, we keep our rhythm simple, intentional and focused on impact. A few core rituals help us stay aligned, support each other, and continuously improve—without falling into the trap of unnecessary meetings.

### 🔁 **Daily Check-ins (Sync or Async)**

Every team at Webeet runs a **daily check-in**, either live or async. This isn’t just about status updates—it’s about surfacing blockers, sharing progress, and staying connected to each other’s work. Choose the format that works for your team, but **show up and share**. That’s how we move together.

### 🧠 **Sprint Planning (Weekly or Biweekly)**

We plan our sprints in **scheduled, live sync meetings**—once a week or every two weeks, depending on the team. These sessions are where priorities are set, scope is clarified, and everyone leaves with a clear understanding of what we’re building next. Come prepared. Respect the time. This is our time to align.

### ✋ **Our Approach to Meetings**

We believe that meetings are often a **necessary evil**. They're useful when used right, but wasteful when overdone. So we follow a few guiding principles:

- **Default to async**. If it can be handled in a message, a doc, or a recording—do that instead.
- **Always have an agenda**. Know why we’re meeting and what decisions we want to walk away with.
- **Start on time, end on time**. Being on time shows respect for your teammates' focus and energy.
- **Be present**. No phones. No multitasking. If you’re in the room, be *in* the room. If you’re not needed—skip it.

Meetings at Webeet are not where work happens. They are a moment to align **so we can go do the real work better**.
