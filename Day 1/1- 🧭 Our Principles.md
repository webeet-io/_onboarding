# 🧭 Our Principles

At Webeet, we believe that our values show in the people we choose to work with. Below are the specific working principles, values, and behaviors we care about most.

### 1. **Growth First**

> **“Pressure is a privilege—it only comes to those who earn it.”**
>
> — _Billie Jean King_

</aside>

Webeet is a real studio, doing real work, for real clients. That means there’s pressure to deliver, to solve problems, and to bring value every day. But we know that growth doesn’t come from getting everything right—it comes from **getting better over time**.

We expect a lot, but we also give you room to learn. Mistakes happen. What matters is that you take responsibility, learn fast, and **turn each challenge into a step forward**.

We hold a simple standard: **do your best today—and do better tomorrow.**

### 2. **Extreme Ownership**

> _“Leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame.”_
>
> _— Jocko Willink & Leif Babin_

No matter your title or experience level, you are empowered to take responsibility—and expected to do so. That means owning your mistakes, your deadlines, your communication, and your impact.

We don’t wait for permission. We step up, we fix things, and we ask how we can help. When everyone takes ownership, everyone grows faster.

### 3. **Team Work**

> _“Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.”_
>
> _— Michael Jordan_

Webeet is built on **collaboration, not competition**. We share credit. We ask for help. We support others without hesitation—because we know that real impact comes from **working together**.

Clients don't just hire an individual. They work with the entire Webeet squad. And that squad only works if everyone is aligned, committed, and invested in each other's success.

### 4. Improve Daily

> _“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”_
>
> _— James Clear_

Improvement isn’t an event—it’s a habit.

Whether you're writing better code, designing a sharper dashboard, or running smoother standups, we believe in **iterating forward every single day**. One percent better may not feel big today, but over time, it changes everything.

### 5. Spread Positivity

> _“How you show up matters. Energy is contagious—choose wisely what you spread.”_
>
> _— Unknown_

Energy is the currency of great teams. Bring it.

Be curious. Be supportive. Celebrate small wins. Offer thoughtful feedback. Show gratitude. Help a teammate who’s stuck.

Everyone here is balancing growth, learning, deadlines—and sometimes imposter syndrome. Your attitude shapes the vibe. Be someone others are grateful to work with.
