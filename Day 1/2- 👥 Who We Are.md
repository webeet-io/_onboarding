<br>
I am the <strong>Founder and CEO of Webeet</strong>, where I lead our mission to bridge the gap between education and industry. With nearly 20 years of experience at the intersection of **technology, leadership, and learning**, Iâ€™ve dedicated my career to building products, teams, and systems that unlock potentialâ€”especially for those just starting out.

Before launching Webeet, I served as **Program Director for Software Engineering at Masterschool**, where I helped hundreds of students launch their careers. That experience showed me the transformative power of hands-on learningâ€”and the frustrating bottleneck many face trying to land their first opportunity.

So I built Webeet: a studio where early-stage startups get the digital services they need, and **Junior Professionals in Engineering, Data, and Cybersecurity** gain their first real experience on impactful projects. Iâ€™m passionate about **designing structures that help people grow**, whether itâ€™s a new product architecture or a professional development track.

At Webeet, I focus on long-term vision, team culture, and making sure every project we take on delivers valueâ€”to our clients, and to the professionals weâ€™re helping launch.
