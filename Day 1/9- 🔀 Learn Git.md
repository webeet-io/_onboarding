# 🔀 Learn Git

To work effectively with GitHub, you need to understand **Git**—the version control system behind it.

Git is what allows us to:

- Track every change to the codebase
- Collaborate without overwriting each other’s work
- Revert mistakes and debug issues
- Review progress over time

Think of Git as the **“undo + time machine + multiplayer mode”** of software and data projects. Even if you’re not writing code every day, knowing Git helps you work smarter, stay organized, and communicate clearly with your team.
