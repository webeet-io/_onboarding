## Threat Modeling: Thinking Like an Attacker

Threat modeling is our process for identifying potential security risks early in the development lifecycle. It's a structured way to ask, "What could go wrong with this feature?" By answering that question before we write code, we can build more resilient and secure systems from the start.

This isn't about creating massive, complex documents. It's about fostering a security-first mindset.

### The STRIDE Model

To help structure our thinking, we use a simple framework called the **STRIDE** model. It's a mnemonic that helps us brainstorm different categories of threats. For any new feature or service, we consider these six threat categories:

-   **S**poofing: Can an attacker impersonate a user or service?
-   **T**ampering: Can an attacker modify data in transit or at rest?
-   **R**epudiation: Could a user deny performing an action?
-   **I**nformation Disclosure: Can an attacker access data they shouldn't?
-   **D**enial of Service: Can an attacker disrupt the service for legitimate users?
-   **E**levation of Privilege: Can an attacker gain more permissions than they should have?

### How We Do It

Our threat modeling process is lightweight and collaborative. For any new, significant feature (like a new microservice or a public-facing API), we follow these steps:

1.  **Whiteboard the Design:** We start by drawing a simple diagram of the feature. What are the components? Who are the users (or services)? How does data flow between them?
2.  **Go Through STRIDE:** With the diagram in front of us, we brainstorm potential threats for each component and data flow, using STRIDE as our guide.
3.  **Identify & Prioritize Risks:** We list the identified threats. We don't need to fix everything, but we must identify the most critical risks.
4.  **Create Mitigation Tasks:** For the highest-priority risks, we create tickets in our project backlog. These are concrete tasks for building defenses, like "add input validation to the API endpoint" or "implement rate limiting."

### Practical Example: Threat Modeling a Log Ingestion Endpoint

Let's apply this to your first mission. Imagine you're building a new endpoint that receives logs from our microservices and sends them to the Elastic Stack.

**Diagram:**
`[Microservice] --(HTTPS)--> [Log Ingestion API] --(Internal Network)--> [Logstash]`

**Applying STRIDE:**

-   **(S)poofing:** Can a rogue service send fake logs to our API?
    -   **Mitigation:** Require the client microservice to authenticate using a token or mTLS certificate.
-   **(T)ampering:** Can an attacker modify the logs in transit?
    -   **Mitigation:** We're already using HTTPS, which encrypts the data in transit. Good start!
-   **(I)nformation Disclosure:** What if a log message accidentally contains a user's password or PII?
    -   **Mitigation:** Implement a sanitization filter in the Log Ingestion API to scrub sensitive patterns before forwarding the log to Logstash.
-   **(D)enial of Service:** What if a buggy microservice sends millions of logs per second, overwhelming our API?
    -   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting on the API endpoint to prevent any single client from flooding the system.

As you can see, this simple exercise helps us identify concrete security requirements before we even start coding.
