## What to Expect in Your DevSecOps Role


Now that you have an idea of our "why" from the welcome page, let's talk about what your day-to-day journey will look like. This page outlines how you'll learn, contribute, and grow as one unified team.


### Your Role: Expanding Your Expertise



Historically, development, operations, and security were separate disciplines. Today, the most innovative companies are integrating them. This modern practice is known as **DevSecOps**, and it's becoming the new standard for building high-quality software securely and efficiently. This internship is an opportunity to build upon that strong foundation by participating in a major shift happening across the tech industry.


As a company with a very strong engineering culture, **webeet** fully supports and advocates for this industry shift. We believe that empowering engineers to both build and secure systems leads to better products and more resilient infrastructure. By learning this integrated approach, you are not just adding skills to your toolkit; you are aligning yourself with the future of software development and becoming a more versatile and valuable professional.


You'll get hands-on experience across the board: getting comfortable in the command line, configuring Linux VMs, and designing cloud networking solutions. You will write Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision our systems, and you will learn how to embed security checks directly into that process. This approach will empower you to not only build robust infrastructure but also to secure it from the ground up.


### Your First Mission: The Observability Platform


You're starting with a critical project: provisioning the core components of our application and setting up our observability platform using the **Elastic Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).


A previous team has already done some foundational work using **Terraform** to provision and configure Logstash. Your mission will be to build on that work.


Your initial tasks will involve:

- Using **Terraform** to provision the infrastructure for our microservices.

- Deploying a message broker (like Kafka or RabbitMQ).

- Setting up the rest of the Elastic Stack to create a full logging and monitoring pipeline.


This project will immediately immerse you in our stack and give you practical experience with cloud services, IaC, and the principles of observability.


### A Hands-On Learning Journey


We don't expect you to know everything on day one. Your learning will be a mix of direct hands-on experience. We expect you to work as a team and get your hands dirty from day one.


1.  **Guided Courses:** The `courses-overview` page will point you to essential courses for CI/CD, Git, and Linux. These are foundational skills for everyone on the team.

2.  **Learn Our Stack:** This dedicated section will be your reference for how *we* use specific technologies. It contains our best practices, code snippets, and key configurations.

3.  **Work:** As you can see from your first mission, you will be working on, impactful tasks from our project backlog that directly affect the development and delivery of our product.


### How You'll Contribute


- **Pair Programming:** You will frequently pair with senior team members and, just as importantly, with each other. This is the best way to share knowledge.

- **Code & Infrastructure Reviews:** You will participate in reviews for `Terraform` modules and application code. This is a key part of our collaborative culture.

- **Ask Questions!** Seriously. We cannot stress this enough. If you're stuck for more than 15 minutes, reach out. Your lead and the entire team are here to support you.


We are invested in your growth and success. Let's get started on the first mission!
