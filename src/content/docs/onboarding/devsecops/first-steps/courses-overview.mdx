## Guided Courses Overview

To support your hands-on work, we've selected a few foundational courses from boot.dev. While your primary learning will happen on the job, these courses are designed to give you the essential vocabulary and skills needed to excel.

**The goal is to complete these courses within your first week as part of your onboarding.** This will ensure everyone on the team shares a common understanding of the critical tools we use every day.

### Primary Course: CI/CD with Go

This is the most important course for your journey here. It will teach you how modern tech companies test and ship products. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** is the engine of modern DevSecOps. It's how we automate the building, testing, and deployment of our software, allowing us to move quickly and safely. The principles you learn here are fundamental to your first mission and all future work.

A key benefit of this course is that you will build a provable project from scratch. We encourage you to host this project on your personal GitHub to start building a professional portfolio. Throughout your internship, you should continue this practice by keeping your Terraform modules and other project code in your GitHub portfolio. This will serve as tangible proof of your skills and accomplishments that you can link on your CV.

**What you'll learn:**
-   **Continuous Integration:** Automate builds and run checks using **GitHub Actions**.
-   **Automated Testing:** Write and run tests, formatters, and linters to maintain code quality.
-   **Security:** Integrate automated security checks directly into the pipeline.
-   **Build & Containerize:** Build a Go project and package it into a **Docker** container.
-   **Deploy to the Cloud:** Deploy your application to the public internet using **GCP** and **Cloud Run**, and connect it to a managed **Turso** database.

### Supplementary Courses

These courses cover tools that are the bedrock of our daily workflow. A solid grasp of these will make you more effective and confident from day one.

#### Learn Git (Parts 1 & 2)

**Git** is the source control system that every developer uses, but few truly understand. It is the foundation of our collaborative workflow. A deep understanding of its internals, branching strategies, and remote workflows is non-negotiable.

**What you'll learn:**
-   **Git Internals:** Understand how Git stores data, not just what commands to run.
-   **Core Workflow:** Master repositories, commits, branching, merging, and rebasing.
-   **Collaboration:** Work effectively with remote repositories and **GitHub**, handling pull requests and keeping project history clean.

#### Learn Linux

You will be spending a lot of time on the command line. This course will help you become comfortable and efficient in a terminal environment so you can "make the command line fear you."

**What you'll learn:**
-   **Core Concepts:** Understand terminals, shells, filesystems, and permissions.
-   **Command Line Mastery:** Learn to execute programs and use powerful tools like pipes for automation.
-   **Environment Setup:** Use package managers like `APT` and `Homebrew` to install software and configure your development environment.
