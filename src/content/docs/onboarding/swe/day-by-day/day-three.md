### Deep Dive - [Zustand](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript)
**Goal:** Learn to create slices, actions, and best practices for organizing the store, moving beyond the basic useState you already know.
### Hands On - Project Setup & UI Scaffolding
**Goal:** Introduce global state management and populate the UI with data.\
**Tasks:**
  1.  Set up a Zustand store.
  2.  Create a `userSlice` and `postsSlice` within the store.
  3.  Populate the store with mock data (a user object, an array of post objects).
  4.  Connect your UI components to the store to display the mock data dynamically.
