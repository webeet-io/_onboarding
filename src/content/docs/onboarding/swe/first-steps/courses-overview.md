## Welcome to the Team!

As you get started on the project, we want to make sure you have all the tools you need to succeed and learn effectively. A key part of this is understanding our technology stack.

To help you get up to speed, we have curated a dedicated "Learn our stack" section in our project wiki. You'll find a collection of hand-picked resources, tutorials, and courses there.

This section covers all the core technologies you will be working with, including:

- TypeScript
- Zustand
- React Router v7
- Fastify
- Jest
- SQLite
- Amparo
- Zod

We highly encourage you to use these materials as you progress through the project plan. They are designed to support your learning every step of the way.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to your mentor if you have any questions.

Happy coding!
