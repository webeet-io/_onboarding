Welcome to the program! To give you a clear idea of what to expect, we've designed a structured daily rhythm to maximize your learning and practical experience.

### 1. The Morning Sync-Up (1-2 hours)

We kick off every day with a team call. This is our time to connect, discuss challenges, set the goals for the day, and dive into key architectural and stack-related topics as a group.

### 2. Deep Dive: Courses & Self-Study

Following the morning session, you will have dedicated time to work through our curated courses. This is your opportunity to dive deep into the technologies and concepts that form our stack, learning at your own pace.

### 3. Hands-On: The Portfolio Project

This is where theory meets practice. The majority of your day will be spent actively building a full-stack project. This isn't just an exercise; it's a real-world application designed to cover every part of our technology stack. By the end of the program, this project will be a cornerstone of your professional portfolio.
