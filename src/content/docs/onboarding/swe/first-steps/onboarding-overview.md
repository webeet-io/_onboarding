Welcome to the team! Our onboarding is built on a simple principle: **you learn best by doing**. We've designed a hands-on experience to help you build a deep, practical understanding of our technology and culture.

### Your Onboarding Journey

Your onboarding _is_ the project. From day one, you will begin building a full-stack application designed to guide you through every part of our technology stack. Whenever you encounter a new challenge or technology, your primary resource will be our internal documentation in the **'Learn our stack'** section of this wiki. This "just-in-time" learning approach ensures that everything you learn is immediately applied in a practical context.

This isn't just a learning exercise; it's an opportunity to build a significant project that will become a cornerstone of your professional portfolio. You'll be working with a modern, in-demand stack, including a **Server-Side Rendered (SSR) frontend with Remix**, a **high-performance Fastify backend API**, and a clean, **modular architecture built entirely in TypeScript**. Having a complex, full-stack application like this is invaluable when it comes to job interviews, serving as a perfect example for past project presentations and giving you a deep well of experience to draw from for technical discussions or timed coding challenges.

### Your Support System

You are not alone in this journey. Your success is our priority, and we have a support system in place to help you.

- **Your Team Lead**: **Tom** is your main point of contact. He is here to help you with any questions, blockers, or architectural discussions. There are no "silly questions"â€”please reach out to him anytime.

- **Using AI as Your Teacher**: We encourage you to use AI tools, but in a very specific way: **as a personal teacher, not as a coder.** Use AI to explain complex concepts from our docs in a different way, act as a Socratic partner to debate design patterns, or clarify why a particular solution works.

### Our Philosophy: Learning Over Productivity

The primary goal of your onboarding is deep learning. Therefore, we have a clear mantra: **Don't trade your learning for productivity.**

Asking an AI to write code will give you a quick result, but it will rob you of the critical learning process that comes from solving a problem yourself. This is our way at Webeet; we advocate for using AI to augment our intelligence and accelerate our learning, not to replace our critical thinking.

This approach is backed by research. A study by Microsoft and Harvard on the impact of AI found that while it can boost productivity, it also risks making us complacent. They note that the most effective model is the "centaur," where humans and AI work together:

> "The idea is that the human provides the judgment, the accountability, [and] the critical-thinking skills."

We want you to build those critical-thinking skills. This project is your opportunity to do just that.
