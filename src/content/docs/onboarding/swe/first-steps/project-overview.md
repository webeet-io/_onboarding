# Onboarding Project: 9-Day Plan

This page outlines the 9-day, 4-hour-per-day schedule for your onboarding project.

This plan is designed to be a challenging but manageable deep-dive into our core technologies. It's broken down into three main phases. Use the navigation to explore each phase and the specific tasks for each day.

- **Phase 1: Frontend Foundation (Days 1-4)**
This phase focuses on building a solid, client-side rendered React application.
- **Phase 2: Backend Development (Days 5-6)**
This phase focuses on creating a Fastify API to power your application.
- **Phase 3: Full-Stack Integration (Days 7-9)**
This final phase brings the frontend and backend together and concludes with a project showcase.
