description: A versatile language for backend development and AI.
---

> **Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language renowned for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It's a cornerstone for backend development, data science, machine learning, and especially **Artificial Intelligence**. Its extensive libraries and frameworks make it an ideal choice for building robust and scalable services.
>
> At Webeet, Python powers our **AI-first services**, particularly our prompt-generation service built with FastAPI. Its ease of use and powerful ecosystem enable us to rapidly develop and deploy intelligent features for our map-based search application.

### **Why Python for AI at Webeet?**

Python's strength in the AI domain comes from several key factors:

- **Vast Ecosystem**: Python has an unparalleled collection of libraries specifically designed for AI and machine learning, such as `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, and `Hugging Face Transformers`.
- **Simplicity & Readability**: Its clear syntax allows developers to focus on the logic of AI models rather than complex language constructs, accelerating development.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Python seamlessly integrates with other technologies, including databases like `PostgreSQL` and web frameworks like `FastAPI`, which are core to our stack.

### **Integrating Generative AI APIs with Python**

Our prompt-generation service is built on integrating with Large Language Models. You'll learn how to connect to popular AI services like GPT-4o and Gemini through their APIs and manage these interactions effectively. This involves understanding how to construct prompts and handle the outputs from these models.
