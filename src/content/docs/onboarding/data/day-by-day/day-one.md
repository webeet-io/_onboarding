# 📊 Day 1 – Onboarding Task

Welcome to Day 1! Today’s task is designed to get you comfortable working with a real dataset and making your first contribution.

## 🧠 Task Summary

You’ll work with a small dataset and perform some basic data exploration. Your goal is to:

- Load and preview the dataset.
- Answer a few exploratory questions.
- Submit your findings and changes in Google Sheets

This helps us ensure your environment is set up correctly and gives you a gentle start into our data workflow.
