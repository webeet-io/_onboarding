Welcome to your 4-day onboarding sprint! This program is designed to introduce you to our real-world data stack and workflows. Each day you'll tackle a focused, hands-on challenge that simulates core parts of our pipeline—from raw data ingestion to analysis and integration.

In every `daily_tasks/day_X/` folder, you'll find:

- 🔗 A link to the task's GitHub Issue (in the README or markdown files)
- 📂 All necessary datasets, database connection details, and starter materials

* 🧑‍🏫 You'll get guided explanations and walkthroughs by a team lead during the morning masterclass.
