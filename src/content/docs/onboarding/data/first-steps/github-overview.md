# 🚀 How We Work with GitHub

Welcome to our GitHub workflow! Here’s a quick guide on how we use branches, issues, and pull requests (PRs) during onboarding and beyond.

---

## 🧭 Onboarding Structure

During onboarding, each intern works from their **own personal branch**. For example:'intern-john-smith'
Each day’s assignment lives in a sub-branch off of your personal branch:'intern-john-smith/day-1'

You complete the assignment on your day-specific sub-branch, and when you're ready to submit

---

## 📥 What is a Pull Request (PR)?

A **Pull Request** is a formal request to merge your code into another branch — in our case, your own personal branch.

When you create a PR:

- A team lead reviews your work
- They may leave comments or suggestions
- Once approved, your day branch is merged into your personal branch
- ✅ After merge, the **day branch is deleted**

PRs are **personal** — even though the instructions (issues) are the same for everyone, your implementation is your own.

---

## ✅ Issues vs PRs

| Type                | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔖 **Issue**        | A shared task or instruction set (same for all interns) |
| 🔄 **Pull Request** | Your personal solution to the issue (unique to you)     |

---

## 🕵️ Respect Boundaries

We do **not** peek at other interns’ branches or work.  
This is a learning space, not a race — we trust and value your individual growth.

---

## 🧑‍💻 GitHub & Code Etiquette

- ✅ **Commit Often**: Don’t wait until everything’s done. Frequent commits = safer progress.
- 🎯 **Clear Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages like `cleaned dataset` or `added db script`.
- 🔄 **Pull before you push**: Sync your branch regularly to avoid conflicts.
- 🧹 **Delete day branches after merging**: Keep your repo clean.
- 💬 **Ask questions in issues or PR comments**: It’s encouraged!

---

## 🛠 When Real Work Starts

Once onboarding ends:

- You’ll work on **shared project branches**, not personal ones
- But you’ll still use:
  - **Issues** to track tasks
  - **PRs** to checkpoint your progress and get reviews before merging

Let’s keep the flow clean, collaborative, and beginner-friendly.
