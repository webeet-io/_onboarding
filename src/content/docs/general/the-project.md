## **Smarter Real Estate Discovery through Map Layers**

### **What are we building?**

We’re building a **map-based platform** that helps people find the best places to live—not just based on listings, but on what matters _most_ to them. By layering data like **crime rates, greenery, transportation, schools, and noise**, users can explore and compare neighborhoods that match their personal preferences.

### **Why is this different?**

Most real estate platforms force users to filter properties and hope the location fits. Our approach flips that: we **start with the place**, letting users explore areas first—then surface listings that align with what they care about. We want people to choose _where_ to live before choosing _what_ to live in.

### **What makes this AI-first?**

This platform is designed from the ground up to be AI-first. Instead of manually toggling filters, users can **describe what they’re looking for in plain language**—

> _“I want a quiet, green area with low crime, good public transport, and a short commute to the city.”_
>
> > The AI will interpret these preferences, **select the relevant data layers**, **assign weightings**, and **highlight the best-matching areas** automatically. Over time, it will learn from user behavior and improve its recommendations.

## 🛠️ What You'll Work On

Interns will collaborate in cross-functional teams to build a **functional prototype** of the platform. Depending on your discipline, you’ll focus on one of the following domains:

### ⚙️ Engineering Team

- Build the **interactive map interface** with toggleable data layers.
- Implement location search and dynamic filtering.
- Connect frontend to backend APIs and AI services.

### 📊 Data Team

- Source and clean public datasets (crime, green zones, transportation, etc.).
- Build scoring models for location quality based on user preferences.
- Integrate early AI models for natural language input and recommendation logic.

### 🛡️ Security Team

Security interns will rotate through **four specialized teams**, gaining exposure to different security mindsets and responsibilities:

- **🔵 Blue Team (Defensive Security)**
  Monitor systems, detect vulnerabilities, and practice incident response.

- **🔴 Red Team (Offensive Security)**
  Act like ethical hackers: simulate attacks, penetration tests, and infrastructure exploits.

- **🟡 Yellow Team (Compliance & Governance)**
  Focus on **privacy**, **legal**, and **regulatory** aspects of the platform.

- **🟢 Green Team (DevSecOps)**
  Build secure cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and apply security best practices in code and architecture.

**Who is this for?**
This platform is for modern home seekers—families, expats, young professionals—who want clarity and control in choosing **where** to live. Whether it’s safety, green space, or commute time, users get insights aligned to _their values_ rather than cookie-cutter filters.
