<p>
I am the <strong>Founder and CEO of Webeet</strong>, where I lead our mission to bridge the gap between education and industry. With nearly 20 years of experience at the intersection of <strong>technology, leadership, and learning</strong), Iâ€™ve dedicated my career to building products, teams, and systems that unlock potentialâ€”especially for those just starting out.
</p>

<p>
Before launching Webeet, I served as <strong>Program Director for Software Engineering at Masterschool</strong>, where I helped hundreds of students launch their careers. That experience showed me the transformative power of hands-on learningâ€”and the frustrating bottleneck many face trying to land their first opportunity.
</p>

<p>
So I built Webeet: a studio where early-stage startups get the digital services they need, and <strong>Junior Professionals in Engineering, Data, and Security</strong> gain their first real experience on impactful projects. Iâ€™m passionate about <strong>designing structures that help people grow</strong>, whether itâ€™s a new product architecture or a professional development track.
</p>

<p>
At Webeet, I focus on long-term vision, team culture, and making sure every project we take on delivers valueâ€”to our clients, and to the professionals weâ€™re helping launch.

  <summary><strong>Alejandro RomÃ¡n IbÃ¡Ã±ez | DevSecOps Team Lead</strong></summary>
I am the DevSecOps Lead at Webeet, where I design secure, automated cloud infrastructure and help junior professionals gain real experience through hands-on projects.
Before entering tech, I served as a paratrooper, an experience that shaped how I handle pressure, lead teams, and solve problems with discipline and focus. I began my journey in software engineering as a backend developer, but over time, my curiosity led me deeper into cloud technologies and infrastructure. That transition sparked my move into DevSecOps, where I now focus on building systems that are scalable, resilient, and secure by design.
Alongside that technical path, I discovered a new passion: mentoring. Helping junior engineers find their footing, grow their skills, and build confidence has become one of the most rewarding parts of my work.
At Webeet, I lead our DevSecOps practice across squads, designing CI/CD workflows, improving observability, and embedding security into every layer of the development process. I also work closely with junior team members, helping them build both technical skills and the mindset needed to grow into reliable, self-sufficient engineers.

<p>
I am a Software Engineering Team Lead at Webeet with a background as diverse as the teams I leadâ€”from UAV systems in the military to the live performance stage as a multi-instrumentalist.
</p>

<p>
My career has been shaped by environments that demand precision, creativity, and adaptabilityâ€”all qualities I now bring to the world of software development.
</p>

<p>
As a freelance musician, Iâ€™ve organized and executed hundreds of live performances and studio sessions, mastering multiple instruments and managing complex technical setups under pressure.
</p>

<p>
In the military, I operated advanced UAV systems in high-stakes missions, developing strong problem-solving skills, situational awareness, and a disciplined approach to teamwork and execution.
</p>

<p>
At Webeet, I guide engineering squads through real-world product development, focusing on collaboration, quality, and continuous learning. I believe great code is like great musicâ€”it requires structure, flow, and a shared rhythm across the team. Iâ€™m here to help junior developers build that rhythm and grow into confident, capable professionals.

<summary><strong>Maria Fadgyas | Engineering Team Lead</strong></summary>
  Iâ€™m Maria, currently serving as an Engineering Team Lead at Webeet. I guide software squads through backend and frontend development, system architecture, and day-to-day mentoring. Iâ€™m especially passionate about helping junior engineers grow through hands-on experience, in an environment that values ownership, simplicity, and curiosity.
Before transitioning into software engineering, I worked in R&D and engineering leadership roles. I led cross-border teams on European Commissionâ€“funded projects and oversaw the development of bioreactor technologies for renewable energy. With a background in structural engineering, I bring a systems-driven mindset and a strong focus on clarity, collaboration, and long-term resilience.
At Webeet, I build scalable backend microservices, lead architecture decisions, and support apprentices as they enter the tech field. One of the most rewarding parts of my role is helping others push through the fear of writing their first real production code - because I remember that exact moment myself.
My journey into software began unexpectedly: while managing a research project, I needed to analyze a complex experimental dataset. With no prior coding experience, I taught myself just enough MATLAB to get the insights we needed. That challenge planted a seed. Years later, I made the leap into software engineering - and I havenâ€™t looked back since.
Blending my technical leadership background with a deep commitment to mentorship, Iâ€™m proud to help shape both systems and the people who build them.

<p>
I am the Data Team Lead at Webeet, with over a decade of experience in risk analytics, fraud detection, and data-driven decision-making.
</p>

<p>
My background spans 13 years at PayPal, where I worked across operations, investigation, and SQL trainingâ€”combining deep analytical skills with a strong focus on collaboration and mentoring.
</p>

<p>
During my time at PayPal, I analyzed thousands of accounts to detect fraud, money laundering, and account takeoversâ€”work that directly reduced financial losses and improved system reliability. I also led SQL training sessions that upskilled entire teams, showing my belief in shared knowledge and continuous growth.
</p>

<p>
At Webeet, I guide data interns and junior professionals as they step into their first real-world projects. My focus is on building clear thinking, solid analytical foundations, and a sense of ownership from day one. I believe data is powerfulâ€”but only when itâ€™s understood, challenged, and used to drive action. Thatâ€™s the mindset I bring to every project and every teammate.
