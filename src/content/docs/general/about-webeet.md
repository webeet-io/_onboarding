### 🔭 Our Mission

> 🌁
> **Bridge Between Training and Industry**

At Webeet, we believe that talent doesn’t grow in isolation—it grows in motion, through collaboration, feedback, and the rhythm of real work.

Our mission is to **bridge the gap between training and industry** by giving aspiring professionals a place where they can apply their learning in meaningful ways from day one.

We are a **digital studio powered by Junior Professionals**—and structured to benefit both sides of the ecosystem. Interns learn by doing, and early-stage startups get the help they need at the very start of their journey.

Webeet exists to unlock first opportunities. Because in tech, getting that first chance is often the hardest part. We’re here to make it easier.

### 🏗️ What We Do

We offer **digital services in Engineering, Data, and Security (specifically DevSecOps)**, delivered by supervised, multidisciplinary squads made up of Junior Professionals and experienced mentors.

Our model is based on **projects with industry impact**—whether that’s building a web app for a new startup, running a market intelligence pipeline, or stress-testing a platform’s security.

Every intern who joins Webeet is embedded in a team, given ownership of tasks, and expected to collaborate as they would in a professional environment. They participate in weekly check-ins, daily standups, and retrospectives. You will be learning our workflows, use industry tools and deliver measurable outcomes.

At the same time, we support **early-stage startups and mission-driven ventures** by providing them with high-quality digital support they can afford. For many of our partners, we are their first tech team. That means that we all have to put our best efforts to ensure we can provide these startups with a meaningful contribution.

### 📆 How It Started

Webeet was launched in **March 2023** as an experiment led by **David Rajcher**, who at the time was the **Software Engineering Program Manager at Masterschool**. While helping students complete their training, he kept seeing the same challenge: they were graduating with skills—but struggling to get that crucial **first experience** that unlocks job opportunities.

David came up with the following solution: establish a studio where junior professionals could **gain hands-on experience** by contributing to industry projects.

What began as a side initiative with one senior, two students, and a single Notion page quickly proved its value. Interns gained confidence. Clients were impressed. Soon, **more projects were coming in than we ever expected**—pushing Webeet to grow from a small experiment into a full-time operation.

What started as a small experiment has now evolved into a **fully functioning company** with a dedicated team supporting all three major domains: **Engineering, Data, and Security**.

We’ve delivered **27 projects** with over **20 companies** so far—and we’re just getting started.
