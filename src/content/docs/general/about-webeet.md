### 🔭 Our Mission

> 🌁
> **Bridge Between Training and Industry**

At Webeet, we believe that talent doesn’t grow in isolation—it grows in motion, through collaboration, feedback, and the rhythm of real work.

Our mission is to **bridge the gap between training and industry** by giving aspiring professionals a place where they can apply their learning in meaningful ways from day one.

We a **digital studio powered by Junior Professionals**—and structured to benefit both sides of the ecosystem. Interns learn by doing, and companies get the help they need at the very start of their journey.

Webeet exists to unlock first opportunities. Because in tech, getting that first chance is often the hardest part. We’re here to make it easier.

### 🏗️ What We Do

We offer **digital services in Engineering, Data, and Cybersecurity**, delivered by supervised, multidisciplinary squads made up of Junior Professionals and experienced mentors.

Our model is based on **real projects with real impact**—whether that’s building a web app for a new startup, running a market intelligence pipeline, or stress-testing a platform’s security.

Every intern who joins Webeet is immediately embedded in a team, given ownership of tasks, and expected to collaborate as they would in a professional environment. They participate in weekly check-ins, daily standups, and retrospectives. They learn our workflows, use real tools and deliver real outcomes.

We don’t create artificial simulations. We don’t water things down. We create a safe but challenging environment that accelerates growth.

At the same time, we support **early-stage startups and mission-driven ventures** by providing them with high-quality digital support they can afford. For many of our partners, we are their first tech team.

### 📆 How It Started

Webeet was launched in **March 2023** as an experiment led by **David Rajcher**, who at the time was the **Software Engineering Program Manager at Masterschool**. While helping students complete their training, he kept seeing the same challenge: they were graduating with skills—but struggling to get that crucial **first real-world experience** that unlocks job opportunities.

David left Masterschool to build a solution: a studio where graduates could **gain hands-on experience** by contributing to real projects for real clients.

What began as a side initiative with one senior, two students, and a single Notion page quickly proved its value. Interns gained confidence. Clients were impressed. Soon, **more projects were coming in than we ever expected**—pushing Webeet to grow from a small experiment into a real operation.

What started as a small experiment has now evolved into a **fully functioning company** with a dedicated team supporting all three major domains: **Engineering, Data, and Cybersecurity**.

We’ve delivered **27 projects** with over **20 companies** so far—and we’re just getting started.
