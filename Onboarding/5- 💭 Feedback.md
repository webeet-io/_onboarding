# 💭 Feedback

At Webeet, we believe that growth only happens when we’re honest—**with ourselves and with each other**. To improve as individuals and as a team, we need to know what’s working, what’s not, and what could be better.

That’s why feedback isn’t just welcome here—it’s essential.

Whether it’s a suggestion, a frustration, or a spark of an idea, **don’t keep it to yourself**. Come talk to us. We’re here to listen, learn, and make things better—together.
