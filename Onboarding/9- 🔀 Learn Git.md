# üîÄ Learn Git

To work effectively with GitHub, you need to understand **Git**‚Äîthe version control system behind it.

Git is what allows us to:

- Track every change to the codebase
- Collaborate without overwriting each other‚Äôs work
- Revert mistakes and debug issues
- Review progress over time

Think of Git as the **‚Äúundo + time machine + multiplayer mode‚Äù** of software and data projects. Even if you‚Äôre not writing code every day, knowing Git helps you work smarter, stay organized, and communicate clearly with your team.

## üìö Learn the fundamentals of git:

### üëâ For Data and Cyber

You don't have to finish all of it, you will during the first week of the onboarding).

This course is **completely free** and does **not require any tracking or payments**. Just make sure to select the **free tier**, which gives you full access to everything you need for onboarding and beyond‚Äîno upgrades necessary.

## Markdown

Markdown makes your GitHub issues easy to read and act on. Headings show the problem at a glance, lists make steps and findings unambiguous, quotes capture context, and code blocks preserve logs and commands exactly. Clear formatting helps teammates reproduce bugs faster, prevents back-and-forth, improves searchability, and shows you can communicate like a professional engineer.

Headings

```
# Title (H1)
## Section (H2)
### Subsection (H3)
```

Emphasis

```
**bold**   *italic*   ~~strikethrough~~
```

Lists

```
- bullet item
- another
  - nested

1. ordered item
2. another
```

Task lists (checkboxes)

```
- [ ] todo
- [x] done
```

Quotes (for highlighting notes or referencing comments)

```
> This is a quote or callout.
```

Code (use for commands, errors, or snippets)

````
Inline: `npm run dev`

Block:
```bash
git fetch && git checkout feature/login
````

Links and images

```

[link text](https://example.com)
![alt text](https://example.com/image.png)

```

Horizontal rule (separate sections) (---)

```
---

```

You can also create beautiful alerts, syntax (must be in a blockquote (```):

GitHub supports five admonitions (‚Äúalerts‚Äù):

- [!NOTE]
- [!TIP]
- [!IMPORTANT]
- [!WARNING]
- [!CAUTION]

Where it works: READMEs and other repo Markdown, Issues, PRs, Discussions, Wikis (GitHub renderer). It‚Äôs a GitHub extension to GFM‚Äînot portable to all Markdown engines.
