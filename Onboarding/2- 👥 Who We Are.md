<br>
<br>

<p>
I am the <strong>Founder and CEO of Webeet</strong>, where I lead our mission to bridge the gap between education and industry. With nearly 20 years of experience at the intersection of <strong>technology, leadership, and learning</strong), Iâ€™ve dedicated my career to building products, teams, and systems that unlock potentialâ€”especially for those just starting out.
</p>

<p>
Before launching Webeet, I served as <strong>Program Director for Software Engineering at Masterschool</strong>, where I helped hundreds of students launch their careers. That experience showed me the transformative power of hands-on learningâ€”and the frustrating bottleneck many face trying to land their first opportunity.
</p>

<p>
So I built Webeet: a studio where early-stage startups get the digital services they need, and <strong>Junior Professionals in Engineering, Data, and Cybersecurity</strong> gain their first real experience on impactful projects. Iâ€™m passionate about <strong>designing structures that help people grow</strong>, whether itâ€™s a new product architecture or a professional development track.
</p>
         
<p>
At Webeet, I focus on long-term vision, team culture, and making sure every project we take on delivers valueâ€”to our clients, and to the professionals weâ€™re helping launch.

<p>
I am a Software Engineering Team Lead at Webeet with a background as diverse as the teams I leadâ€”from UAV systems in the military to the live performance stage as a multi-instrumentalist. 
</p>

<p>
My career has been shaped by environments that demand precision, creativity, and adaptabilityâ€”all qualities I now bring to the world of software development.
</p>

<p>
As a freelance musician, Iâ€™ve organized and executed hundreds of live performances and studio sessions, mastering multiple instruments and managing complex technical setups under pressure. 
</p>

In the military, I operated advanced UAV systems in high-stakes missions, developing strong problem-solving skills, situational awareness, and a disciplined approach to teamwork and execution.
</p>

<p>
At Webeet, I guide engineering squads through real-world product development, focusing on collaboration, quality, and continuous learning.

<br>

<p>
I am the Data Team Lead at Webeet, with over a decade of experience in risk analytics, fraud detection, and data-driven decision-making. 
</p>

<p>
My background spans 13 years at PayPal, where I worked across operations, investigation, and SQL trainingâ€”combining deep analytical skills with a strong focus on collaboration and mentoring.
</p>

<p>
During my time at PayPal, I analyzed thousands of accounts to detect fraud, money laundering, and account takeoversâ€”work that directly reduced financial losses and improved system reliability. I also led SQL training sessions that upskilled entire teams, showing my belief in shared knowledge and continuous growth.
</p>

<p>
At Webeet, I guide data interns and junior professionals as they step into their first real-world projects. My focus is on building clear thinking, solid analytical foundations, and a sense of ownership from day one. I believe data is powerfulâ€”but only when itâ€™s understood, challenged, and used to drive action. Thatâ€™s the mindset I bring to every project and every teammate.
