# Introduction 👋

You're about to begin your **Webeet Studio onboarding**—a short but meaningful introduction to who we are, what we believe in, and how we work. These first few hours are just the start. Like a seed planted in rich soil, the true value of this experience will grow over time—through your learning, your contributions, and the relationships you build here.

At Webeet, we're passionate about two things: **technology** and **education**.

We believe that the best way to learn is by doing—and that junior talent, when supported and trusted, can deliver real impact. That's why our studio is designed to be both a **launchpad for interns and junior professionals** and a **reliable partner for startups** at the earliest stages of their journey. 

🌉 **We bridge the gap: delivering essential digital services while giving aspiring professionals a meaningful first step into the industry.**

Your time here won’t just be about tasks and tickets. It’s about growth, ownership, and shared purpose.

Below is the list of lessons included in your onboarding.
