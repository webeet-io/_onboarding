# Admonitions (Alerts):

GitHub supports five admonitions (“alerts”):
- [!NOTE]
- [!TIP]
- [!IMPORTANT]
- [!WARNING]
- [!CAUTION]

Syntax (must be in a blockquote (```):

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information...

> [!TIP]
> Do the fast thing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Required for success.

> [!WARNING]
> Might break stuff.

> [!CAUTION]
> Risky; proceed carefully.

Where it works: READMEs and other repo Markdown, Issues, PRs, Discussions, Wikis (GitHub renderer). It’s a GitHub extension to GFM—not portable to all Markdown engines.
